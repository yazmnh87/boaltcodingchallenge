# WELCOME, THANK YOU BOALT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY


```
Thank you for reviewing my coding challenge
requirements:
-Create an Android app, That is publicy available
-Use React Native
-Allow the user to watch a video(With Full Screen Option) 
-Allow user to stream on a TV
-Include 1 to 2 animations when switching screens
```

This app successfully plays video, allows you to pause, but unfortunately misses the requirement to cast to a TV. Through my research I found the package 'React-native-google-cast' this package allows you to cast video to a TV but only will render its components when a chromecast is detected on the network.  Unfortunately I do not have a chromecast to test with and was unable to find another package to accomplish this with.  Thank again look forward to speaking with you more.
